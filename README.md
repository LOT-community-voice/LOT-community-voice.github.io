# 大型光学-红外望远镜科学共同之声 (Community Voice of the Chinese Large Optical/Infrared Telescope)

------

_Last update: 2017-08-05_

中国天文学界正积极筹备建设一架口径12米的通用光学-红外天文望远镜 (LOT)--为中国下一代天文学家服务的旗舰设备。

Chinese astronomical community has been preparing the construction of a general purpose, 12-meter optical-infrared telescope - the flagship instrument for the next generation of Chinese astronomers. 

**网站目标**：分享和LOT的科学目标与技术设计相关的关键文档并鼓励基于科学的公开讨论。

Website Goals: share key documents regarding the scientific motivations and the designs of LOT, and encourage science-driven, open discussions about this crucial project.
